    <h2>My bio</h2>

    <p>My name is Ever Grijalva. I'm 20 years old and a freshman at New England Tech. I've been playing video games since I was 5. I first got into video games through my dad who owned a PS2. We'd play games like Burnout 3, DBZ Budokai, and Ace Combat. By myself I would play a lot of Sonic The Hedgehog, countless times for hours on end. Video games have always intrigued me. From the coding, to the level design, to the art work, everything. I even want to take an art course whenever possible. One of my favorite video games of all time is Final Fantasy VII. I've played it countless times and own too many copies. I want to game design because I love video games and want to make my own one day, mostly likely independent. When I'm not at school, I'm playing games, or hanging out with friends. I want to get into reading, since friends have reccommended me some good books, and I'm looking forward to reading when I feel like it haha. I also enjoy watching anime. FullMetal Alchemist is one of my favorites of all time, along with Dragon Ball Z. Attack On Titan is my favorite anime from the 2010's, but it's hard to decide which is my favorite of all time. I can't wait to sit down and learn the video game program.</p>
